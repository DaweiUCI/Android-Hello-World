Android-Hello-World
===================

## Notes

* This application was built for the Nexus 7, and is locked in landscape orientation. Understandably, many device screens will not like the layout. Feel free to tinker around with the view in res/layout/activity_main.xml
* Audio support is not enabled
* Please let me know if/how this app crashes on your Android device. We use the Camera and MediaRecorder Android classes and I expect there will be some native issues from device to device
* You may need to create a new token/session to connect. Visit our token generation page if this is the case: http://www.tokbox.com/opentok/api/tools/generator
* There is javadoc for the SDK in libs/opentok-android-sdk-docs. The API for the SDK is not complete; this build is meant to evaluate hardware, not build comprehensive applications.
